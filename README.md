# Rather Dapper Expense Tracker

## Features

✔️ Minimalist, focused interface that shows your accounts and transactions, no logins or loading times required.

✔️ Keeps long-term assets separate, so you can know your liquid net worth after all credit cards / debts are paid off.

✔️ Fast time/date entry in text format, allowing transactions to be entered quickly using Tab and Enter keys.

✔️ Responsive grid system from Bootstrap ensures it works well at a variety of screen sizes.
